## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

**Weather-to-Wear** is a progressive web app (PWA) and micro-service backend that:

* imports your personal wardrobe via quick photo capture,  
* pulls local forecasts from dual weather APIs,  
* runs an on-device ML model to rank outfits (with layering advice),  
* learns from your 1-5 star rating feedback, and  
* lets you share your style with friends in a real-time social feed.

The goal: **make ‚ÄúWhat should I wear today?‚Äù obsolete**‚Äîno matter the season, location, or schedule.
