# User Stories 

# EPIC A: Wardrobe Management 
1. As a registered user, I want to add a clothing item by taking a photo and filling in its details, so that the item appears in my digital wardrobe.
2. As a user, I want to edit or delete any wardrobe item I own, so that my closet stays accurate.
3. As a user, I want to search and filter my wardrobe by category, colour, material, or tag, so that I can quickly find what I need.
4. As a user with a large wardrobe, I want images to upload in the background and be compressed automatically, so that the app feels fast and doesn’t consume excess data.

# EPIC B Weather Integration 
1. As a user, I want the app to detect my current location and fetch the local forecast, so that outfit suggestions match the weather where I am.
2. As a system, I want to fall back to a secondary weather API when the primary provider is unavailable, so that users continue to receive forecasts.
3. As a user, I want forecasts to refresh every 6 hours, so that I see up-to-date conditions.

# EPIC C Recommendation Engine 
1. As a user, I want to receive at least one ranked outfit recommendation for a selected day, so that I know what to wear.
2. As a user, I want recommendations to include layering advice when temperatures vary widely, so that I stay comfortable all day.
3. As a user, I want to rate an outfit with a 5-star system, so that the system can learn my preferences.
4. As the engine, I want to incorporate user-feedback data into future rankings within 24 hours, so that suggestions improve over time.

# EPIC D Social Sharing 
1. As a user, I want to post a picture of my outfit with a short caption, so that I can share my style with followers.
2. As a follower, I want to like and comment on friends’ outfit posts in real time, so that we can engage socially.
3. As a user, I want to set my post’s visibility to public, followers-only, or private, so that I control who sees my content.
4. As the system, I want to scan images and text for offensive content before publishing, so that the platform remains safe and inclusive.

# EPIC E Emergency Outfit Updates (Optional) 
1. As a user, I want to receive a push notification when the weather changes significantly (e.g., sudden rain), so that I can adjust my outfit.
2. As a user, I want the notification to include a quick-change recommendation (e.g., swap jacket), so that I know exactly what to do.

# Epic F Fashion Time-Machine Planner (wow) 
1. As a user, I want to drag and drop an outfit onto a future calendar date, so that I can plan what to wear for upcoming events.
2. As a user, I want the app to auto-update planned outfits if the long-range forecast changes, so that my plan stays relevant.

# EPIC G Virtual Try-On (wow) 
1. As a user, I want to preview the recommended outfit on a live AR overlay of myself (or on a 3-D avatar), so that I can visualise how it looks before deciding.
2. As a user with limited bandwidth, I want the try-on feature to fall back to a simple 2-D overlay if my device can’t render full 3-D, so that the feature works for everyone.

# EPIC H Cross-cutting 
1. As a new user, I want to sign up quickly with my name, email and password , so that I can access the app immediately.
2. As a travelling user, I want to open the app offline and still view my wardrobe and the last fetched recommendations, so that I’m not locked out without data coverage.
3. As the system, I want to synchronise any offline posts or ratings when the device regains connectivity, so that data remains consistent.
