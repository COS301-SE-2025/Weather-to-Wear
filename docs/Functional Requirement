## Weather to Wear

---

### F-1 Clothing-Catalog Management
F-1.1 The system shall allow a user to add a wardrobe item by taking a photo and completing a short form (name, category, material, weather-appropriateness, tags).
F-1.2 The system shall let the user edit or delete any wardrobe item they own.
F-1.3 The system shall provide search, filter and sort capabilities over the wardrobe (e.g., by category, colour, material).

### F-2 Weather-Data Integration
F-2.1 The system shall retrieve a location-specific weather forecast (min/max temperature, precipitation, wind) from at least one external API.
F-2.2 If the primary provider fails, the system shall automatically fallback to a secondary API without user intervention.
F-2.3 Weather data shall be refreshed at a configurable interval (default: hourly) so that recommendations stay current.

### F-3 Wardrobe-Recommendation Engine
F-3.1 Given a forecast and the user’s wardrobe, the system shall produce at least one ranked outfit recommendation for a selected day.
F-3.2 The engine shall learn from user feedback captured through a simple rating mechanism (like / dislike).
F-3.3 Recommendations shall include layering advice when forecasts indicate significant temperature variation throughout the day.
F-3.4 The engine shall exclude items marked unsuitable for the predicted conditions (e.g., “water-only jacket when no rain”).

### F-4 Social-Sharing Platform

### F-7 \[O] Emergency-Outfit Response

### F-8 \[W] Fashion Time-Machine Planner
1. The system shall allow users to attach events or trips to future calendar dates.

### F-10 Cross-Cutting Functionalities
